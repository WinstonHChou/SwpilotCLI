## Sup Tools

User-defined tools that extend SwpilotCLI functionality. Place your custom tools here in subdirectories following the same structure as Main Tools.

### swpilotcli-ActionGroup-replace-notes

**Description**: [ActionGroup] Batch replace text inside Note annotations across all SolidWorks drawings (.slddrw) in a specified folder (root only)." For each drawing, opens it silently, finds all Notes containing the search text, replaces every occurrence, saves a copy with a custom suffix to a specified output folder, then closes the original without saving. Reports which files were changed and how many notes were replaced per file. Use when you need to find-and-replace note text across multiple drawings in one shot.

**Path**: `./sup_tools/swpilotcli-ActionGroup-replace-notes/`

### swpilotcli-batch-xt-to-step

**Description**: Batch convert Parasolid `.x_t` and `.xt` files in a specified folder to STEP `.step` files in the same folder. Scans the folder root only, creates same-name `.step` outputs, suppresses template-selection prompts by forcing default part templates, and closes each temporary import document after export. Use when you need one-shot XT to STEP conversion for a local folder.

**Path**: `./sup_tools/swpilotcli-batch-xt-to-step/`

### swpilotcli-check-dangling-dims

**Description**: Scan all dimensions in the active SolidWorks drawing and report which ones are dangling (unattached). Lists every dimension with its type, value, and name, marking dangling ones with [!]. Outputs a summary count at the end. Use before running a repair tool, for QC checks before release, or whenever you need to know if a drawing has dangling annotations.

**Path**: `./sup_tools/swpilotcli-check-dangling-dims/`

### swpilotcli-close-doc

**Description**: Close SolidWorks document(s). Supports three modes via argument: no argument or "nosave" closes the active document without saving; "save" silently saves then closes the active document (if file has never been saved, forces close without saving); "all" closes every open document without saving. Use when the user wants to close the current file, close and save, or close everything.

**Path**: `./sup_tools/swpilotcli-close-doc/`

### swpilotcli-delete-orphan-sketches

**Description**: Delete all orphaned sketches in the active SolidWorks part ??sketch features not absorbed by any extrusion, cut, or other parent feature.

**Path**: `./sup_tools/swpilotcli-delete-orphan-sketches/`

### swpilotcli-diagnose-ic-rigidity

### Template

To create a new sup tool:

1. Create directory: ./sup_tools/your-tool-name/
2. Add required files:
   ``
   your-tool-name/
   ??? SKILL.md              (required, with YAML frontmatter)
   ??? API_REFERENCE.md      (recommended)

## Migration to Agent Skills

All tools in this registry are designed to be directly compatible with Claude Agent Skills.

### Step 1: Prepare your tools

Ensure your tools follow the official structure:
``
tool-name/
??? SKILL.md
??? API_REFERENCE.md (optional)
??? README.md (optional)
??? scripts/
    ??? YourProject/
        ??? YourProject.csproj
``

### Step 2: Copy to ~/.claude/skills/

``ash
# Copy main tool
cp -r ./main_tools/swpilotcli-active-doc-info ~/.claude/skills/

# Copy sup tool
cp -r ./sup_tools/your-tool-name ~/.claude/skills/
``

### Step 3: Update SKILL.md if needed

If migrating from SwpilotCLI to standalone Agent Skills:
- Update dotnet run paths (may need adjustment in different environment)
- Update prerequisites if needed
- No changes to YAML frontmatter required
